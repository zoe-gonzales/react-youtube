## React YouTube Search

### This is the first app I made in React. It uses the YouTube API and Reactstrap for styling/layout.

### Instructions:
* Enter a keyword in the search bar; the app will automatically search this term, no need to press enter.
* Once searched, the first 10 videos related to this search will appear. Clicking on one will display it in the main viewer, where it can be played. 
* Click the "X" to clear the search bar for a new search.
